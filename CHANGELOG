- FIX: The ResizedControlWindow event was fired when actually nothing had changed.



Version 1.1.0 - 24/01/2011

- Changed the type of IExplorerListView::AutoArrangeItems property from Boolean to an enumeration and added the "intelligent" mode where items get auto-arranged only if no item has been positioned manually.
- Changed the type of IExplorerListView::FullRowSelect property from Boolean to an enumeration and added the "extended" mode in which marquee (lasso) item selection is still possible.
- Changed the IListViewItem::TileViewColumns and IVirtualListViewItem::TileViewColumns properties. Both properties don't work with arrays of column indexes anymore, but with arrays of TILEVIEWSUBITEM structs.
- Changed the TileViewColumns parameters of the _IExplorerListViewEvents::ItemGetDisplayInfo event and the IListViewItems::Add() method. Arrays of TILEVIEWSUBITEM structs are used now.
- Changed the type of item and column texts from VARIANT to BSTR (BSTR is String in Visual Basic 6) to improve performance. When you previously specified 'Empty' to make the ItemGetDisplayInfo event raise, you now need vbNullString (NULL for C++).
- Renamed the members of the ArrangementStyleConstants enumeration to fix naming collisions.
- Changed the definitions of the RequestedInfoConstants enumeration to fix naming collisions with ComboListBoxControls.
- Removed the 'modifierKeys' parameter of the IExplorerListView::CaretItem property. It wasn't really working anyway.

- Added a new property page that can be used to enter Unicode texts at design time.
- FIX: Clearing the CaretItem property could select all items.

- FIX: The hit-testing flags 'htGroupStateImage', 'htGroupSubSetLink', 'htContent', 'htFooter', 'htGroupHeader', 'htGroupFooter', 'htGroupExpando', 'htGroupBackground' and 'htGroup' were never set.
- FIX: The OptionListView WTL8 sample didn't work on all systems.
- FIX: If the control was placed on a Form for which the KeyPreview feature was activated, the Form_Key* handler didn't receive key strokes like Alt+PgDown or Alt+Left, if the control had the keyboard focus.
- FIX: The 'shift' parameter that many events have, often missed the ALT key.
- Massively reduced the usage of GDI handles.
- Made some internal changes that will make it easier for me to keep binary compatibility in future.
- It is no longer necessary to subclass the control's parent window and reflect the WM_CONTEXTMENU message to make the ContextMenu event work.
- Deploy (stripped) symbols with the binaries to make debugging easier. This are the pdb files in case you wonder.

- Renamed the IExplorerListView::EmptyText property to EmptyMarkupText.
- Removed the IListViewGroup::Hidden property.
- Removed the IVirtualListViewGroup::Hidden property.
- Removed an ugly hack, because it caused several problems. Unfortunately this means, that the ContextMenu event won't work out of the box anymore and that Unicode support is limited. To make both things work 100%, you must implement subclassing. See the FAQ for details.
- Passing an index of -1, IListViewItems::Item won't fail anymore. Instead it will return an IListViewItem object that may be used to set some properties for all items in the control at once.
- Improved IExplorerListView::Font, IExplorerListView::HotMouseIcon and IExplorerListView::MouseIcon.
- FIX: The control crashed if it was destroyed from within an event handler.
- FIX: Moving the control without resizing it could lead to a control width or height of 0.
- FIX: If a version prior to 6.0 of comctl32.dll was used, inserting items could mess up some internal data structures. This also led to items reporting wrong values for the ItemData property.
- FIX: If a version prior to 6.0 of comctl32.dll was used, deleting items messed up some internal data structures. This also led to items reporting wrong values for the ItemData property.

- FIX: Drag-images for non-OLE-drag'n'drop didn't play well with auto-scrolling.

- FIX: Drag-images with 32bpp icons looked ugly.
- FIX: Drag-images didn't contain overlay images.
